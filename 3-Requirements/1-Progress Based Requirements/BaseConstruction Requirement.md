Requirement for having built a base.

_Note that this is based on the stock ProgressNode - I'm not 100% sure what they do and do not consider a 'base'_.

    REQUIREMENT
    {
        name = BaseConstruction
        type = BaseConstruction

        // Target celestial body.  Defaults to the targetBody of the contract.
        targetBody = Kerbin
    }
