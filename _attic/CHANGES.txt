Contract Configurator 0.5.0
- RemoteTech integration!
  - KSCConnectivity parameter - indicates that a vessel must have connectivity back to mission control.
  - HasAntenna parameter - indicates that a vessel must have one or more antenna that meet specific criteria.
  - SignalDelay parameter - requires a min/max signal delay for a connection.
  - VesselConnectivity parameter - checks for connectivity between two vessels.
  - CelestialBodyCoverage parameter - verifies that there is communication coverage of a celestial body.
  - ActiveVesselRange requirement - requires that a celestial body has a satellite with a minimum active vessel range (achievable via either an omni antenna or dish targetting active vessel).
  - CelestialBodyCoverage requiremnt - requirement for having a dish pointed at the given celestial body.
- Vessel tracking!
  - New define attribute of VesselParameterGroup to associate the ship that completes the parameter to the given name.
  - New vessel attribute of VesselParameterGroup to require a specific vessel (previously defined using define) to be the one to complete the parameter.
  - IsNotVessel parameter for exclusion (eg. to have two VesselParameterGroup parameters in a contract that must be met by different vessels).
- Added Duration parameter.
- Added PartValidator parameter and deprecated HasPart and HasPartModule.
- Merged all orbital parameters into Orbit parameter.  Thanks ttagreis for contributions on altitude and period.
- Added PartModuleTypeUnlocked requirement.
- Changed default values for disableOnStageChange in parameters to be more logical.
- Added new validation to check for unexpected values in config nodes - helps when developing contract configuration.
- Reloading contract types will also re-run module manager (which means you can now reload contract types that use module manager).
- Minor bug fixes

Contract Configurator 0.4.5

- Added OrbitalPeriapsis parameter (thanks tattagreis).
- Fixed defaults for SCANsatCoverage requirement.
- Moved debug key from Alt-F9 to Alt-F10.

- Added VisitWaypoint parameter (for use with WaypointGenerator behaviour).
- Added OrbitGenerator behaviour.  Allows creation of orbits.
- Added ReachSpecificOrbit parameter (for use with OrbitGenerator behaviour).
- Added HasCrew requirement.  Allows filtering on trait, experience level and count.
- Updated HasCrew parameter to support trait and experience level filtering.
- Added VesselMass parameter.
- Added Facility requirement - requires that a player has a facility upgraded to a specified level.
- Added SCANsatCoverage parameter and requirement (big thanks @tattagreis on the SCANsat integration).
- Added support for turning up log levels through the ContractConfigurator.cfg file (thanks @tattagreis).
- Fixed a bug in the HasPart parameter for parts with an underscore in the name (thanks @tattagreis).
- HasCrew now errors if minCrew > maxCrew (thanks @tattagreis).
- Most requirements are no longer checked on active contracts.  Exposed attribute to override default behaviour through config file (thanks @scerion).
- Added ability to reload all CONTRACT_TYPE nodes on demand (via Alt-F9).
- Various minor bug-fixes.

Contract Configurator 0.3.4
- Fixed incompatibility with Tweakscale.

Contract Configurator 0.3.3
- Persistant data store can now store config nodes.
- Fixed an issue with maxCompletions not working correctly (thanks @tattagreis).

Contract Configurator 0.3.2
- (0.90) Support for KSP 0.90
- (0.90) Fixed VesselHasVisited (note the valid values for situation changed)
- Fixed a bug in the handling of VesselParameterGroup that would cause the countdown timer to reset when switching vessels.

Contract Configurator 0.3.0
