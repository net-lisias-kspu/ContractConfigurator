## The BEHAVIOUR node

The BEHAVIOUR node defines a contract behaviour - any behaviour that is at the contract level.  These can provide functionality for parameters, be used to persist data from contract to contract or any number of other things.

The behaviours listed on the navigation bar to the right are natively supported by ContractConfigurator.
