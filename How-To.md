## Creating a new contract

To create new contracts create a new .cfg file in your mod's directory (or if you're creating a new mod, create a new sub-directory under GameData).  The file name can be anything you choose.  In the file, create a CONTRACT_TYPE node, like this:

    CONTRACT_TYPE
    {
    }

And then start adding to it!  See the [[Contract Type|Contract-Type]] page for the full syntax.  Or if you want to look at some examples, check out the [[test directory|https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/tree/master/test]].
